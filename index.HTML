        <p>
            But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, 
            the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, 
            because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally 
            encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, 
            because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. 
            To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? 
            But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, 
            or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"

            <li>Stress relieve your way into a solution</li>
            <li>A problem shared is a problem halved</li>
            <li>Simplify your logic</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Rubber Duck Debugging Method:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Obtain a rubber duck (bathtub variety).</li>
            <li>Place rubber duck on desk and inform it you are just going to explain some code.</li>
            <li>Go into detail and explain your code line by line.</li>
            <li>Tell the duck what you are doing next and then realise that that is not in fact what you are actually doing</li>
            <li>Fix code and be happy.</li>
        </ol>
